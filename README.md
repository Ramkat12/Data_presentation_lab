In this repository , I will be explaining the analysis that I did on my Tablue . 
The link to my tablue  is  - [Tablue Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joy7082/viz/DataPresentationLab_16769034815980/Presentationdashboard?publish=yes)
## The Dataset
The dataset is atteched in my repositiry as ProsperLoanData.
# Summary of the anaysis
## Background
 First of all  we shall start by understanding the background to the analysis.
 For this  assignment I work for a peer to peer money market application where users can borrow and lend money. Led by a team with experience in running technology projects in the financial and education sector, the app integrates the power of crowdfunding. The app being a market place for lending and borrowing money provides an automated matching of a borrowing and lending request with money being disbursed within seconds to a borrower's account.<br/>
My goal of analysis is to Study the given dataset then provide recommendations on how to mitigate the risk of defaults. 
## My analysis
1) I first started by analysing the total amount of the original loan amount as per the Credit Grade based on the loan status group that was default and found out that credit grade **C** has the highest total amount of original loan t,I named the sheet as *Credit Grade*.<br/>
2) I then analysed the borrower State with the highest total amount delinquent based on the loan status that was default and found out that the State with the highest  defaulted amount delinquent was **Carlifonia**.I named the sheet as *Borrower state*.<br/> 
3) I analysed the total amount delinquent for each income range based on the defaulted loan status and found out that the income range with the highest amount delinquent was the income range between **$25,000-$49,999**.I named the sheet as *Income Range*<br/>
4) I analaysed the total amount defaulted for based on borrower's home ownership for the defaulted loan status and found out that the group that has the highest amount delinquent is the **group of borrowers that own a home**.I named the sheet as *homeowner*<br/>
5) I also did an analysis on the total loan original amount based on the loan original year for the defaulted loan status and found that the year **2007** had the highest loan original amount of **12,984,543**.I named the sheet as *loan original amount*.<br/>
6) I also analysed the estimed profit and the estimated loss for each profile rating , I found out that **Profile C** had the highest **Estimeted profit** and **Profile D** had the highest **Estimated Loss**.I named the sheet as *Prosper rating*
7) I analysed the estimated loss and amount delinquent for the defaulted loan status  group , I did the analysis to show the borrowers occupation,the borrowers,income range , their amount delinquent and the estimated loss.I found out that **the borrower with the highest estimated loss had an income range of *$25000-$49999* , their occupation was in the group *Other* and their total amount delinquent was *$221,461***.I named the sheet as *Estimated Loss*.<br/><br/>
**Below is an image of my Dashboard ,so that you can understand the above explanation , each visualisation has a title exactly named as the sheet to avoid confusion.I have also attached a presentationdashboard.pdf incase you would like to download the dashboard.**<br/>

# Conclusion
a) I found out that the Credit Grade **C** had the highest total amount of loan original amount with the borrowers whose loan status is Defaulted.<br/>
b) I found out that **Carlifonia** is the state with the highest amount delinquent for the borrowers whose loan status is defaulted.<br/>
c) I can conclude that the group of borrowers whose income range lies between **$25000-$49999$** and whose loan status is defaulted have a high amount delinquent.<br/>
d) It is safe to say that the group of borrowers **who are homeowners** and whose loan status is default have a high total amount delinquent.<br/>
e) It is safe to say that the year that had a high amount of loan original amount for borrowers whose loan status is default was the year **2007**.<br/>
f) I can conclude that the Prosper rating **C** had the highest amount of *Estimated profit* was the rating **C** , the prosper rating with the highest *Estimated loss*  was the uwas the rating **D**.<br/>
e) I can say that the highest estimated loss for a loan given to a borrower whose loan status is defaulted is **14.48**, the borrower has an income range of *$25000-$49999* and is in the occupation group *Other*.<br/>

# Recomendations
- I would recommend that the application reduce the amount of loan given to the borrowers with an income range of **$25000-$49999*.<br/>
- I would recommend that the application reduce the amount of loans given to the borrowers who are hoem owners.<br/>
- I would recommend that caution should be put when giving out loans to the borrowers with a credit grade **C**.<br/>
- I would recommend that the aplication should focus more on the prosper rating **C** since it has a high estimated profit.<br/>
- I would recommend that the application should look more into the year **2007** to find out why that year had the highest amount of loan by people borrowers whose loan status is defaulted hence find out what could be done to reduce the amount of loans given to default borrowers.<br/>
